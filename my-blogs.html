       <small class="ite">Assault Rifle</small>
       <p>
        The AKM is an assault rifle type weapon in BATTLEGROUNDS. The AKM<br> (Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanny, lit. Modernized Kalashnikov<br>Automatic Rifle) is an improved version of the original AK-47 first developed<br> in 1959, featuring improvements and refinements in manufacturing and materials<br> to create a modernized version of one of the most recognizable firearms in the world.<br> Especially popular with freedom fighters, insurgents, and guerrilla forces, in<br> BATTLEGROUNDS its stopping power makes it popular for close-quarters combat.A powerful assault rifle that uses 7.62mm ammunition, this rifle does more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles and comes with a kick to match. In regards to attachments, the AKM is identical to the M16A4 in that it can only accept a muzzle, magazine, and sight attachment. It is best used in single-shot mode except when attempting to breach buildings with it.

        At close to medium ranges, it is notable in that even if a target is wearing a military vest and/or Spetsnaz helmet, it only takes a maximum of five shots to kill. It is also capable of killing a Spetsnaz helmet wearer in two shots by landing a shot on the head, then finishing them off with another shot to any other part of their body.
        
        The AKM will deal maximum damage within 50 meters, beyond that distance damage will continually decrease out to 290 meters. Thus, it is not recommended to engage sufficiently armored players at longer ranges as the recoil and lower bullet velocity compared to other rifles will prove landing consistent hits difficult.A powerful assault rifle that uses 7.62mm ammunition, this rifle does more damage than the 5.56mm assault rifles and comes with a kick to match.
