    <p>
        Afrer  june in 2020  every night I see you  in my  dreams. I feel you all the times. Then I feel that I am in love with you. I found my love. And it's you and it's 2020 when I found my love. 2020 changed me it's changed my thinkings. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2020 I found a girl who is stronger than anyone I know. She makes me a lover and it's you baby. I love you a lot baby. In 2020 I feel that I found  the bone of my left forearm. So I can't lose you. So I can forget all the bad things in 2020 because I find you in this year and I want celebrate every new year with  you. So I think you forgive my all bad works all shit things.

        People just get excited after falling in love.  But when I first saw you, there was no excitement.  But when I fell in love with you, a strange feeling began to work.  Then he wants to run mile after mile to see you.  I want to hold on to you all the time.
